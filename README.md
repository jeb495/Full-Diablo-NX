# DevilutionX (Diablo 1) for Nintendo Switch

## Installation

1. Download and unzip [FullDiabloNX.zip](https://github.com/jeb495/Full-Diablo-NX/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
2. Put `devilutionx.nro` and `CharisSILB.ttf` in into `/switch/devilutionx`


## Usage

Launch `devilutionx.nro`. (Do not use album to launch; see the note below.)

*Note:* Hold R on any installed game and launch it. Do not use album to launch. If you use album, the homebrew will only have a small amount memory available, and the touch keyboard won't work. This is true for all homebrew, not just DevilutionX.
